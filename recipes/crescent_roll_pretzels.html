          Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
          with parchment paper and set aside.

          Combine 8 cups water and baking soda in a large pot and bring to a
          rolling boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat and keep water
          at a simmer.

          Start at the large end and roll each crescent roll triangle into a
          large rope, about 12 inches long. Form rope into the shape of a
          pretzel.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using a spider strainer, lower 1 pretzel at a time into the simmering
          water for 7 to 8 seconds. Place pretzels on parchment lined baking
          sheet. Combine egg and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. Brush each
          pretzel with egg mixture.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Remove from oven. Brush each pretzel with melted butter and sprinkle
          with coarse salt while still hot.
