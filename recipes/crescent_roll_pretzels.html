    <h3>directions</h3>
    <h5>step 1</h5>
    <p>
      Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
      with parchment paper and set aside.

      Combine 8 cups water and baking soda in a large pot and bring to a rolling
      boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat and keep water at a simmer.

      Start at the large end and roll each crescent roll triangle into a large
      rope, about 12 inches long. Form rope into the shape of a pretzel.

    <h5>step 4</h5>

      Using a spider strainer, lower 1 pretzel at a time into the simmering
      water for 7 to 8 seconds. Place pretzels on parchment lined baking sheet.
      Combine egg and 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl. Brush each pretzel
      with egg mixture.

    <h5>step 5</h5>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes</p>
    <h5>step 6</h5>
    <p>
      Remove from oven. Brush each pretzel with melted butter and sprinkle with
      coarse salt while still hot.
