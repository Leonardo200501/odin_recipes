    <p>
      These are very close to the regular deep fried churros. Serve with hot
      chocolate, or dipped in a chocolate sauce.
    </p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <p>
      1 1/4 cups water 5 tablespoons cold unsalted butter<br />
      2 packed tablespoons brown sugar<br />
      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />
      1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br />
      1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />
      2 large eggs<br />
      2 tablespoons melted butter for brushing on before sugaring<br />
      cooking spray<br />
    </p>
    <h3>Cinnamon Sugar:</h3>
    <p>
      1/3 cup white sugar<br />
      1 tablespoon cinnamon<br />
      1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
    </p>
    <h3>directions</h3>
    <h5>step 1</h5>
    <p>
      Combine water, butter, brown sugar, and salt in a saucepan over medium
      heat and bring to a simmer. Add flour all at once and cook, stirring,
      until a soft, sticky dough ball forms, and a starchy film coats the bottom
      of the pan, about 5 minutes.
    </p>
    <h5>step 2</h5>
    <p>
      Continue cooking for about 1 minute more, scraping the film off the bottom
      of the pan as you stir. You won’t have a clean bottom surface, but some
      will be reabsorbed by the dough.
    </p>
    <h5>step 3</h5>
    <p>Transfer to a bowl and let cool for 10 minutes.</p>
    <h5>step 4</h5>
    <p>
      in vanilla extract and eggs, 1 at a time, and mix in using a spatula. The
      mixture will separate at first, but eventually it will smear together into
      a sticky dough.>
    </p>
    <h5>step 5</h5>
    <p>
      Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets
      with silpat mats or parchment paper.
    </p>
    <h5>step 6</h5>
    <p>
      Transfer dough into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip (I used a number
      356 tip). Pipe out 3 to 4 inch ropes onto the prepared baking sheets,
      spaced a few inches apart. Use the back of a knife to “cut” through dough
      at the end of each piping, to get a clean end. Since this makes 28 to 30
      bite-sized churros, p ipe 14 to 15 onto each baking sheet.
    </p>
    <h5>step 7</h5>
    <p>
      Once piped, spray tops of the churros with vegetable oil spray, and then
      spray water generously all over the pan.
    </p>
    <h5>step 8</h5>
    <p>
      Bake in the preheated oven until churros are puffed and the edges are
      browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Turn off the oven, and open the door for about
      10 seconds to vent heat. Close the door, leaving it open about 8 to 12
      inches, and let churros rest in the oven for 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <h5>step 9</h5>
    <p>
      Remove from the oven, and working in batches of 6 at a time, brush them
      lightly with melted butter, and then toss to coat in a bag of cinnamon
      sugar.
