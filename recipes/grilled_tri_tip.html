    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <p><ul>
      <li> pounds tri-tip roast</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled and very thinly sliced</li>
      <li>⅓ cup salt</li>
      <li>⅓ cup black pepper</li>
      <li>⅓ cup garlic salt or to taste</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>directions</h3>
    <ol>    
      <li><p>
        Using a sharp knife, cut small slits in the top of the roast; insert
        garlic slices into the slits.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Mix salt, pepper, and garlic salt together in a small bowl; rub all over
        the tri-tip and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 1 day. Remove
        tri-tip from the refrigerator about 20 minutes before grilling.
      </p></li> 
      <li><p>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</p></li>
      <li><p>
        Place the meat directly above the flame to sear the meat and lock in the
        juices, about 5 to 10 minutes per side.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Turn the grill down to medium heat and continue to cook, turning
        occasionally, for another 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for
        medium-rare. Let stand, covered loosely with aluminum foil, for 5 minutes
        before slicing.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Remove from oven. Brush each pretzel with melted butter and sprinkle with
        coarse salt while still hot.
      </p></li>
    </ol>
